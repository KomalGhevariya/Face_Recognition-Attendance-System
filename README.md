# Face_Recognition-Attendance-System

## Overview
The **Face Recognition Attendance System** is an innovative project designed to automate attendance management using facial recognition technology. 
It employs advanced computer vision and machine learning algorithms to detect and recognize faces in real-time, ensuring accuracy and eliminating the need for manual attendance tracking.

## Features
- **Real-Time Face Detection**: Automatically detects faces from a live video stream or images.
- **Face Recognition**: Identifies and verifies individuals using unique facial features.
- **Automated Attendance Logging**: Marks attendance and stores it in the database with timestamps.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface for administrators to manage attendance records.
- **Database Integration**: Securely stores attendance logs for future reference.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Dlib for facial feature extraction and recognition.
  - OpenCV for image processing and face detection.
  - NumPy for numerical computations.
- **Database**: SQLite or MySQL
- **Tools**: Visual Studio Code 

## How It Works
1. **Face Detection**:
   - The system detects faces using advanced algorithms (e.g., HOG or CNN models).
2. **Face Recognition**:
   - Extracts unique facial embeddings for each detected face.
   - Matches embeddings with stored data to identify individuals.
3. **Attendance Logging**:
   - Logs recognized faces with names and timestamps into the database.
   - Generates attendance reports for review.

## Setup and Installation
